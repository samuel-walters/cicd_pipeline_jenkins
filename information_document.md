## Webhook and API difference

An API is a messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you. On the other hand, Webhook, also called reverse API, web callback, or an HTTP push API is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. It delivers data as an event happens or almost immediately.

​​APIs are request-based, meaning that they operate when requests come from 3rd party apps. Webhooks are event-based, meaning that they will run when a specific event occurs in the source app.

​​The main difference between them is that webhooks do not need to give a request to get a response while API demands requests to get a response. In other words, webhooks receive, while API retrieves.

## Jenkins: Difference between Master Node and Agent Node

The Jenkins master acts to schedule the jobs and assign slaves and send builds to slaves to execute the jobs.

It will also monitor the slave state (offline or online) and getting back the build result responses from slaves and the display build results on the console output. The workload of building jobs is delegated to multiple slaves.

(There's flexibility though - one node does the app testing etc)

## NGINX 

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

## Reverse Proxy

In computer networks, a reverse proxy is the application that sits in front of back-end applications and forwards client (e.g. browser) requests to those applications. Reverse proxies help increase scalability, performance, resilience and security.

## SSH

SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol. Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.

# What makes a good CI CD Pipeline

Ultimately, the purpose of employing CI/CD is that teams can generate fast, accurate, reliable, and comprehensive feedback for their development cycle. Therefore, a proper pipeline should cover these factors: speed, accuracy, reliability, and comprehension.
